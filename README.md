##Bluecabod's Projects for Practicing Python

This is a repository used for storing (in a portfolio-esque manner) my python projects as I learn the language. Feel free to comment on a recent project's commit if you think it will help me.

###Projects Included

- Python 2.7.x
  1. **strstore.py:** First python code. I made this to learn some basic python functionality
  2. **gmLibrary.py:** Uses gmusicapi to retrieve a list of your songs on google play. Made because I wanted an easy way to see all the songs I had on Google Play All Access without using a clunky web interface. Useful if changing music services! 
    - **If you use secondary authentication** for your Google account you will need to generate an application specific key for this.
    - gmusicapi: http://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
    - This will output a file called gmusiclibrary in .csv format in the same directory
